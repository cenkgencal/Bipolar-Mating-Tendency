Instead of creating a complicated selection method, can a simple method solve the problems that GAs generally get stuck in? This question sheds light the way of reaching Bipolar Mating Tendency (BMT) selection method.
The main idea of BMT was influenced by Standard Tournament (ST). It randomly selects two groups of individuals from the population, candidates of the first mate and the second mate. The first mate is the fittest individual among the first group members as in ST. Contrary to the first mate selection, the second mate has ambiguous fitness property. Depending on the first mate’s psychological state that is bipolar, the second mate can be either the best individual or the worst individual from the second group members. The first mate’s psychological state is determined by a random value. If the random value is less or equal than bipolarity value, the second mate will be the best of second group. This procedure is identical to ST. However, if the random value is greater than bipolarity value, the first mate displays an unusual behavior that chooses the worst individual in the second group for mating.
